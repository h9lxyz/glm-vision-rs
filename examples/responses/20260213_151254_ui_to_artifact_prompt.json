Send a message to get started.\"\n\n**Tools Section:**\n- Title \"TOOLS\" with \"8 registered\" count\n- List of 8 tools with:\n  - Tool name (spawn_subagent, use_skill, edit_file, read_file, web_fetch, list_dir, write_file, exec)\n  - Description text for each tool\n  - Light gray background for each item\n\n**System Section:**\n- Title \"SYSTEM\"\n- Grid of system metrics cards showing:\n  - MEMORY (RSS): 34.8 MB with \"Process resident memory\"\n  - CPU TIME: 2.0s with \"Total user + system CPU\" \n  - UPTIME: 50m with \"1 active, 35 archived\"\n  - Workspace metrics with file sizes and paths\n\n**Color Scheme:**\n- Background: #1a1f2e (dark navy)\n- Text: #e2e8f0 (light gray/white)\n- Accent: #3b82f6 (blue)\n- Status: #10b981 (green)\n- Card background: #252a3d (slightly lighter dark)\n\n**Typography:**\n- Use Inter or similar sans-serif font\n- Hierarchy: \n  - Large bold for titles\n  - Medium for stats numbers\n  - Regular for descriptions\n\n**Responsiveness:**\n- Ensure layout adapts to different screen sizes\n- Cards should wrap appropriately on smaller screens\n\n---\n\n## Prompt Structure Breakdown\n\nI've organized the prompt to follow the visual hierarchy of the interface, starting from the overall layout and moving to specific sections. This logical flow helps the AI understand the spatial relationships and component structure. Each major section is clearly separated with headings, making it easy to map to the visual elements in the screenshot.\n\n---\n\n## Key Details Captured\n\n1. **Color scheme**: Precise hex values for background, text, and accent colors\n2. **Layout structure**: Sidebar, header, grid layouts, and section organization\n3. **Typography hierarchy**: Font weights and sizes for different text elements\n4. **Interactive elements**: Navigation states, status indicators, hover effects\n5. **Data content**: Exact text, numbers, and descriptions from the screenshot\n6. **Iconography**: Mention of appropriate icons for each section\n7. **Responsiveness**: Basic adaptation instructions\n8. **Empty states**: Specific messaging for empty sections\n\n---\n\n## Usage Notes\n\nThis prompt is designed to work with AI tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, or UI generation AIs. For best results:\n\n- Use with tools that support detailed UI description\n- If using an image generator, you may need to supplement with visual examples of the desired style\n- For code generation, this prompt provides sufficient detail for a React/Vue component\n- Adjust specificity based on the AI's capabilities (some may need more/less detail)\n- The color hex values ensure visual accuracy across different implementations\n\nThe prompt balances specificity with flexibility, allowing the AI to interpret the design intent while maintaining the core visual elements and structure of the original interface.",
