The terminal shows that when attempting to run the command `casda fsd`, the shell couldn't locate an executable named `casda` in the system's PATH. This is a common shell error indicating that the specified command doesn't exist or isn't accessible from the current environment.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe error occurred because:\n- The command `casda` is not installed on your system, or\n- The command exists but isn't in your shell's PATH environment variable, or  \n- There's a typo in the command name\n\nThis is happening in a Zsh shell (visible from the prompt format), likely in a development environment given the git repository context (`webui git:(feature-webui)`). The command appears to be a custom or third-party tool that hasn't been properly installed or configured.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Immediate Fix\n1. **Check for typos**: Verify the correct spelling of the command. If it should be `casda`, ensure you're typing it correctly.\n2. **Install the command**: If `casda` is a legitimate tool, install it using your package manager:\n   ```bash\n   # For Homebrew (macOS)\n   brew install casda\n   \n   # For npm\n   npm install -g casda\n   \n   # For Python pip\n   pip install casda\n   ```\n\n3. **Check PATH**: If the command is installed but not found, add its location to your PATH:\n   ```bash\n   # Find where casda is installed\n   which casda\n   \n   # Add to PATH (temporary)\n   export PATH=\"$PATH:/path/to/casda\"\n   \n   # Or add permanently to your .zshrc\n   echo 'export PATH=\"$PATH:/path/to/casda\"' >> ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n### Alternative Approaches\n- **Use full path**: If you know the exact location, run it directly:\n  ```bash\n  /full/path/to/casda fsd\n  ```\n\n- **Check aliases**: The command might be aliased to something else:\n  ```bash\n  alias casda\n  ```\n\n## Prevention\n\nTo avoid similar issues:\n1. **Verify command existence**: Always check if a command exists before trying to run it:\n   ```bash\n   command -v casda >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo \"casda not found\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Use package managers**: Install development tools through proper package managers rather than manual installation.\n\n3. **Document dependencies**: Keep track of required tools in your project documentation or README.\n\n4. **Use version managers**: For language-specific tools, use version managers (nvm, rbenv, etc.) to ensure consistent environments.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\nThe error occurred in what appears to be a web development project (based on the \"webui\" repository name). If `casda` is a development tool specific to this project, check:\n- The project's `package.json` or similar dependency files\n- Any installation scripts or setup instructions\n- Whether the tool should be installed locally (npm install) or globally\n\nIf this is a custom script, ensure it has the executable permission:\n```bash\nchmod +x /path/to/casda\n```",
        "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this screenshot carefully.\n\nFrom the screenshot, I can see:\n1. A terminal window with a command prompt showing \"webui git:(feature-webui) x\" \n2. The error message: \"zsh: command not found: casda\"\n3. The user appears to have typed \"casda fsd\" but the command \"casda\" was not found\n\nThis is a shell error in what appears to be a Zsh shell (common on macOS). The error indicates that the command \"casda\" is not recognized by the shell.\n\nLet me break this down:\n- The error type is a \"command not found\" error, which is a common shell error\n- It occurred when the user tried to run the command \"casda fsd\"\n- The shell (Zsh) couldn't find an executable named \"casda\" in the system's PATH\n\nThis could be because:\n1. The command doesn't exist on the system\n2. The command exists but isn't in the PATH\n3. There's a typo in the command name\n4. The command requires installation\n\nLooking at the context, this appears to be a development environment (the \"webui\" repository with a \"feature-webui\" branch), so it might be related to a development tool or script.\n\nThe fix would involve either:\n- Installing the missing command\n- Adding the directory containing the command to the PATH\n- Using the correct command name\n- Running the command with its full path\n\nLet me provide a comprehensive analysis and solution.",
