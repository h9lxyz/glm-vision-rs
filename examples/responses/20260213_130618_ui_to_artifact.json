Overview  \nThe interface is a **dark-themed dashboard** for a tool named *Nanobit*, designed to provide an at-a-glance view of system status, agent activity, tools, and recent interactions. The layout follows a **sidebar + main content** structure: a fixed left sidebar contains navigation, while the main area displays key metrics, agent status, activity logs, tools, and system resources. The design prioritizes clarity and scannability, with a focus on real-time data (e.g., live status indicators) and actionable information (e.g., clickable agent cards, tool descriptions).\n\n\n### 2. Detailed Description  \n#### Sidebar (Left)  \n- **Top Section**: Contains the *Nanobit* logo (a circular icon with the text \"NANOBIT\" below it) and a tagline (\"Your AI Assistant\").  \n- **Navigation Menu**: A vertical list of menu items with icons, including:  \n  - *Dashboard* (selected, highlighted with a blue background and white text)  \n  - *Chat* (circle icon)  \n  - *Pipeline* (triangle icon)  \n  - *Sessions* (square icon)  \n  - *Agents* (diamond icon)  \n\n#### Main Content Area (Right)  \n- **Header**:  \n  - Title: \"Dashboard\" (large, bold white text).  \n  - Status Indicator: A green dot labeled \"Live\" followed by the version \"g1m-4.7\" (smaller, gray text).  \n\n- **Metric Cards (Top Row)**: Six rectangular cards in a horizontal row, each with an icon, large number, and descriptive label:  \n  1. *Active Sessions*: Square icon, \"1\" (white), \"Active Sessions\" (gray).  \n  2. *Total Messages*: Circle icon, \"20\" (white), \"Total Messages\" (gray).  \n  3. *Registered Tools*: Gear icon, \"8\" (white), \"Registered Tools\" (gray).  \n  4. *Agents*: Diamond icon, \"4\" (white), \"Agents\" (gray).  \n  5. *Uptime*: Clock icon, \"50m\" (white), \"Uptime\" (gray).  \n  6. *Archived Sessions*: Square icon, \"35\" (white), \"Archived Sessions\" (gray).  \n\n- **Agents Section**:  \n  - Heading: \"AGENTS\" (gray, uppercase).  \n  - Four agent cards (horizontal row), each with:  \n    - A green dot (live status).  \n    - An icon (e.g., KrillMeister has a bug icon, Atlas has a map icon, Nova has a rocket icon, Echo has a lightning bolt icon).  \n    - Agent name (white text).  \n    - A badge (e.g., KrillMeister has a blue \"DEFAULT\" badge; others have \"g1m-4.7\" in gray).  \n\n- **Recent Activity & Tools (Two-Column Layout)**:  \n  - **Left Column**: \"RECENT ACTIVITY\" (gray, uppercase) with a message: \"No activity yet. Send a message to get started.\" (gray text, centered).  \n  - **Right Column**: \"TOOLS 8 registered\" (gray, uppercase) with a list of 8 tools. Each tool entry includes:  \n    - Tool name (bold white text, e.g., \"spawn_subagent\").  \n    - Description (gray text, e.g., \"Spawn an independent subagent to handle a complex task asynchronously...\").  \n\n- **System Section (Bottom)**:  \n  - Heading: \"SYSTEM\" (gray, uppercase).  \n  - Seven rectangular cards (horizontal row) displaying system resources:  \n    - *MEMORY (RSS)*: \"34.8 MB\" (white), \"Process resident memory\" (gray).  \n    - *CPU TIME*: \"2.0s\" (white), \"Total user + system CPU\" (gray).  \n    - *UPTIME*: \"50m\" (white), \"1 active, 35 archived\" (gray).  \n    - *NOVA WORKSPACE*: \"628 B\" (white), \"/home/h9l/.nanobit/agents/...\" (gray).  \n    - *DEFAULT WORKSPACE*: \"296.2 KB\" (white), \"/home/h9l/.nanobit/workspa...\" (gray).  \n    - *MAIN WORKSPACE*: \"296.2 KB\" (white), \"/home/h9l/.nanobit/workspa...\" (gray).  \n    - *ECHO WORKSPACE*: \"24.3 KB\" (white), \"/home/h9l/.nanobit/agents/...\" (gray).  \n  - An additional card: *ATLAS WORKSPACE*: \"5.9 KB\" (white), \"/home/h9l/.nanobit/agents/...\" (gray).  \n\n\n### 3. Visual Characteristics  \n- **Color Scheme**:  \n  - Background: Dark navy (#1a1b2e or similar).  \n  - Text: White (primary), gray (secondary), blue (accent for selected items/badges).  \n  - Status Indicators: Green (live), blue (default badge).  \n- **Typography**:  \n  - Headings: Sans-serif (e.g., Inter), bold, white (large for \"Dashboard\", medium for section headings).  \n  - Body Text: Sans-serif, gray (smaller for descriptions/labels).  \n- **Shapes & Borders**:  \n  - Cards: Rounded corners (8-10px), subtle shadow or border to separate sections.  \n  - Icons: Simple line icons (white) for metrics and agents.  \n- **Spacing**: Generous padding between sections (e.g., 20px margin around the main content) and within cards (e.g., 16px padding inside metric cards).  \n\n\n### 4. Interaction Flow  \n1. **Navigation**: Users click menu items in the sidebar (e.g., *Chat*, *Agents*) to switch views. The *Dashboard* is the default, selected view.  \n2. **Agent Interaction**: Clicking an agent card (e.g., *KrillMeister*) likely opens a detailed view of the agent’s status or settings.  \n3. **Tool Exploration**: Users scroll through the *TOOLS* list to read descriptions of available functions (e.g., \"spawn_subagent\" for asynchronous tasks).  \n4. **System Monitoring**: The *SYSTEM* cards provide at-a-glance stats (e.g., memory usage, uptime) with no direct interaction, but may link to deeper system details if clicked.  \n5. **Activity Tracking**: The *RECENT ACTIVITY* section prompts users to send a message to generate logs, indicating a chat-based workflow.  \n\n\nThis description captures the interface’s structure, visual hierarchy, and functional elements, enabling a developer to recreate the design with attention to detail.",
        "reasoning_content": "Got it, let's tackle this UI description. First, I need to start with the overview. The interface is a dashboard for a tool called \"Nanobit\" with a dark theme. The layout has a sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right. \n\nNext, the sidebar: it has the Nanobit logo at the top, then a navigation menu with items like Dashboard (selected), Chat, Pipeline, Sessions, Agents. Each menu item has an icon. \n\nThen the main content area: the top has a \"Dashboard\" heading with a live status indicator (green dot) and a version number. Below that, there are six metric cards in a row—Active Sessions, Total Messages, Registered Tools, Agents, Uptime, Archived Sessions. Each card has an icon, a number, and a label. \n\nBelow the metrics, there's an \"AGENTS\" section with four agent cards: KrillMeister (default), Atlas, Nova, Echo. Each agent has a green dot (live status), an icon, name, and version. \n\nThen there's a \"RECENT ACTIVITY\" section on the left and \"TOOLS\" on the right. The Recent Activity has a message saying no activity yet. The Tools section lists 8 registered tools with their names and descriptions. \n\nAt the bottom, the \"SYSTEM\" section has several cards showing memory, CPU time, uptime, and workspace sizes. \n\nNow, visual characteristics: dark background (maybe #1a1b2e or similar), light text (white or light gray), blue accents for selected items and links. Icons are simple, maybe line icons. Cards have rounded corners and a slight shadow or border to separate them. \n\nInteraction flow: User navigates via the sidebar, clicks on Dashboard (currently selected), views metrics, agents, tools, and system info. The agents are clickable, tools are listed with descriptions, system cards show stats. \n\nWait, need to make sure to mention the exact elements: the live dot is green, the version is \"g1m-4.7\", the metric cards have icons like a square for Active Sessions, circle for Total Messages, gear for Registered Tools, diamond for Agents, clock for Uptime, square for Archived Sessions. \n\nAlso, the agent cards: KrillMeister has a blue \"DEFAULT\" badge, others have icons (Atlas has a map, Nova has a rocket, Echo has a lightning bolt). \n\nTools list: each tool has a name in bold, then a description. The system cards have labels like \"MEMORY (RSS)\" with the value \"34.8 MB\" and a sublabel. \n\nNeed to structure this clearly, following the output structure: Overview, Detailed Description, Visual Characteristics, Interaction Flow. \n\nLet me check each section again. Overview: purpose is a dashboard for Nanobit, layout is sidebar + main content. Detailed Description: sidebar elements, main content sections (metrics, agents, recent activity, tools, system). Visual Characteristics: colors (dark background, light text, blue accents), typography (sans-serif, maybe medium weight for headings), spacing (padding between sections, cards with margin). Interaction Flow: how users move through the interface, what they can click. \n\nMake sure to be specific about the elements: the \"Live\" indicator with a green dot, the version number, the metric card icons, the agent badges, the tool descriptions, the system stats. \n\nAlso, mention the hierarchy: the dashboard heading is the most prominent, then metrics, then agents, then recent activity/tools, then system. \n\nOkay, let's put it all together.",
